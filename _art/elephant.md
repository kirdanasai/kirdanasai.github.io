"What's the matter with his ears? I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em. I think they're cute." - Timothy Q. Mouse 🐘 •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• This one was for @thulasyp because I’ve always thought they were her favourite animal aha (I was wrong😂)😘. And also for @lindsaysugi because she has the cutest reason behind loving elephants, kind and compassionate just like herself🤍
